# Lute

Tune your string instruments (guitar, bass, ukulele, rebecha, etc).

## TODO:

  * write tests
  * also build css and html into `dist` folder
  * for guitar by default, each string pitch can be changed by half-steps
  * load tuning configurations (standard guitar, drop d, standard bass, etc.)
  * capture sound from mic and compare frequencies
